description: "Enforce structured 6-step debugging methodology to systematically diagnose and resolve code issues. Prevents ad-hoc debugging approaches that lead to incomplete fixes or new bugs."

# Model Configuration
model: sonnet  # Claude Sonnet for complex reasoning and hypothesis generation

# Activation Configuration
activation:
  keywords:
    - debug
    - fix
    - error
    - failing
    - broken
    - not working
    - issue
    - problem
    - bug

  triggers:
    # Automatic activation on these conditions
    - bash_error          # Non-zero exit codes
    - test_failure        # pytest, npm test failures
    - stack_trace         # Error stack traces detected
    - assertion_failure   # Failed assertions
    - build_failure       # Compilation/build errors

# Tool Permissions
tools:
  - Read              # Read code and error logs
  - Edit              # Implement fixes
  - Write             # Create test files
  - Bash              # Run tests, reproduce errors
  - Grep              # Search for related code
  - Glob              # Find relevant files
  - TodoWrite         # Track debugging steps

# Execution Configuration
execution:
  mode: interactive     # Requires user confirmation for each step
  timeout: 600         # 10 minutes for complex debugging
  max_iterations: 6    # One iteration per debugging step

# Metadata
color: red            # Red indicates debugging/error handling
priority: high        # Debug issues are high priority
